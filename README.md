INTRODUCTION 
Consuming video content has become a major way to share knowledge, learn 
new things, and pass along amusement in the current digital era. Despite 
dominating this market with their extensive content libraries and sophisticated 
personalisation, platforms like YouTube frequently have drawbacks including 
invasive ads, excessive user tracking, and a lack of customisation options. 
 
Edutainment Cinema was created to address these challenges and investigate the 
possibilities of creating cutting-edge, immersive web apps. Using React.js, 
Material UI 5, and the YouTube Data API v3 accessed using RapidAPI, this 
project is a condensed YouTube clone. It provides an ad-free, distraction-free, 
and user-centric video streaming experience while also serving as a thorough 
learning model for developers looking to build scalable and feature-rich front
end applications. 
Through a clear and user-friendly primary search bar, Edutainment Cinema 
allows users to search and enjoy videos across genres. Additionally, it integrates 
Web Speech API-powered voice search capabilities, enhancing user ease and 
accessibility. Because the interface is entirely responsive, PCs, tablets, and 
smartphones can all view and interact with it at their best. A sleek and expert 
appearance is further enhanced by branding components like the title 
"Edutainment Cinema," which is placed next to the logo. 
 
Beyond its technical execution, the project demonstrates a dedication to user 
privacy, performance, and clean design. It is perfect for educational institutions, 
content-focused users, and everyone else looking for a customisable and clutter
free video platform because it only concentrates on content and usability.
